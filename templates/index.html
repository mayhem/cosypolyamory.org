        <h2>Welcome to the Cosy Polyamory Community!</h2>
        <p>
            We are a welcoming space for people exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory">polyamory</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monogamy">ethical non-monogamy</a>. Our community hosts events where you can learn more about polyamory, meet like-minded individuals, and build connections in a safe and friendly environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our core values are fairness, equality, and transparency. We encourage members to participate in ways that feel comfortable—whether that’s attending events, sharing ideas, or helping to create a cosy, inclusive atmosphere. Together, we strive to support one another and say <b>yes</b> to opportunities that bring us closer as a community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our events include social gatherings, book clubs, hikes, beach outings, and more. We’re always open to new ideas, and members are encouraged to propose events that interest them.
        </p>
